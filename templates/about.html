        <p>This is an Unofficial Habits app based off the best selling book "Atomic Habits"</p>
        <p>If you don't have it I recommend clicking the image below,to first get the book</p>
        <p>as I don't explain any of the concepts used in this app.</p>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1578138979&sr=8-1" target="_blank">

      <p>So if you've already read the book, you'll want to go straight to "Create a Habit" or "Destroy a Habit".</p>
      <p>After you've filled out the questionaire, you're new habit will appear in the "Habit List".</p>
      <p>Voila! you'll then have a habit sheet, with the option to print it out, make changes or review it on the App. </p>
